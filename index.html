        <h3>Laurel's top 10 places to visit in the world</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Crowsnest Pass, AB</p>
                <p>This showcases one of my favourite mountains in Canada: Crowsnest Mountain. There's something so beautiful about the way the mountain juts up to the sky from all the greenery below. Lucky me, I took part in two mountain runs in this area and plan to return. There is also a really cool story about "Frank's slide": one of Canada's deadliest rock slides. It happened more than 100 years ago and you can still see all of the boulders at ground level that resulted from it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meteora, Greece</p>
                <p>Maja! This is home to a stunning natural rock formation with several monasteries built on top. This is also where Paul asked me to marry him in 2012 when we spent three weeks touring Greece. It is a very special, spiritual place. We also enjoyed delicious Greek food there! Our favourites were saganaki (oven-baked cheese), pitas and hummus, olives and red wine! My mouth is watering just thinking about it !!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mount Etna, Italy</p>
                <p>This is an active volcano on the east coast of Sicily. We took a bus all the way up and then walked around, looking at the craters and smoldering rock. One really neat thing I learned is that the soil in volcanic regions is incredibly fertile and great for growing things! The lemons and oranges in the town below were delicious!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>South Shields, England</p>
                <p>This town has a special place in my heart because this is where my dad was born and where he lived until he was seven years old and came to Canada with his family! It is right on the cliffs of the North Sea where fishermen earn a living. There are pubs and bed and breakfasts dotting the coastline and you can smell the fresh, salty sea air wherever you go. If you took a boat north and east of this town you might hit Norway, where your ancestors originate from!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pai, Thailand</p>
                <p>When I was finished journalism school I went on one of my biggest adventures with my sister Heather and Matt. We visited a cave near Pai, Thailand at sunset. Every night 300,000 sparrows fly in and 500,000 bats fly out at the same time. It was a spectacle. As you can imagine, we were looking up for hours - with our eyes open and mouths shut! Haha</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rome, Italy</p>
                <p>There is something really special about seeing architecture that is hundreds and hundreds of years old! When Paul's sister got married we went to Rome with his family. We walked and ate and walked and ate! I highly recommend visiting the Vatican, the Colosseum, and the markets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Angkor Wat, Cambodia</p>
                <p>These are ancient temples that have been overrun by the majestic forests. Giant roots have cracked through the foundations of the temples. It's one of the most incredible things I've ever seen :) If you go at sunrise and sit on the top of the highest temple, you will be amazed!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>New York</p>
                <p>The Big Apple is a great place to visit because you can see so much in a short period of time! I highly recommend visiting the World Trade Centre museum, the Freedom Tower, Central Park and, of course, the Statue of Liberty. We visited Lady Liberty by boat at sunset and I cried imagining all of the people who travelled from tough places to freedom in North America. She would have been the first thing they saw.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sumatra, Indonesia</p>
                <p>We went for a five-day jungle trek here and it was incredible. We ate lychee fruit from the trees and drank water from the streams. We saw orangutans in the wild. I hope to bring Ewan and Finn here one day. :)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edmonton, AB</p>
                <p>This is a hidden gem in Canada. You can bike in a giant River Valley, eat at one of hundreds of interesting restaurants and take in some great museums all in one day! And you are welcome to come and stay with us anytime. Finn and Ewan will be sharing bunk beds a year from now, which means we will have a guest room! :)</p>

        <h3>Top 10 memories from Vlad</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finding out that your mom and dad were expecting you!</li>
            <li>First time meeting you at the airport in Edmonton. Your smile melted my heart right away.</li>
            <li>The gigantic hug you gave me when I came to see you in Seattle.</li>
            <li>You giving me a guided tour of the house and providing me with numerous sleeping places.</li>
            <li>You waking me up at 6:45am and telling me that it was playtime and what we would be doing that day. I may have been slightly hungover but there was no way I was missing that opportunity.</li>
            <li>Our walk/bike ride on the waterfront in Seattle.</li>
            <li>You giving me an education in LOL dolls, telling me all about the different kinds, their accessories, etc. The sparkle you had in your eyes was priceless.</li>
            <li>Having a chance to be a part of your bedtime routine. I loved listening to you tell me and your parents about what the best part of your day was.</li>
            <li>That day when we had breakfast and you got very teary and upset about me leaving. You holding me close and giving me gigantic hugs when we got to the airport. Just so you know, I cried too. :)</li>
            <li>Not really a memory for you just yet, but I want you to know that my heart fluttered a little bit when I knew that I would be seeing you soon.</li>
